# Locker 

## Fully function physical storage management app using Java REST API, React frontend, MySQL database, allows users to create and manage lockers, containers, and items in storage

Locker was an idea born out of the desire to better organize my stuff. As someone who has had to move their belongings from place to place many times and has had items get lost in the move, I wanted to think up a way to keep track of my items in a way that ensures nothing is left behind. In that spirit, Locker is an ongoing project that aims to outsource the cognitive overhead of physical storage management to a simple organizational tool.

This project uses
* React
* Spring Boot
* MySQL
* Google Maps API
